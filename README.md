# Abstract
Conservation of biodiversity demands comprehension of evolutionary and ecological
patterns and processes that occur over vast spatial and temporal scales. A central goal
of ecology is to understand the climatic factors that control ecological processes and
this has become even more important in the face of climate change. Especially at global
scales, there can be enormous uncertainty in underlying environmental data used to
explain ecological processes, but that uncertainty is rarely quantified or incorporated
into ecological models. In this study a climate-aided Bayesian kriging approach is used
to interpolate 20 years of daily meteorological observations (maximum and minimum
temperature and precipitation) to a 1 arc-minute grid for the Cape Floristic Region of
South Africa. Independent validation data revealed overall predictive performance of
the interpolation to have R2 values of 0.90, 0.85, and 0.59 for maximum temperature,
minimum temperature, and precipitation, respectively. A suite of ecologically-relevant
climate metrics that include the uncertainty introduced by the interpolation were then
generated. By providing the high resolution climate metric surfaces and uncertainties,
this work facilitates richer and more robust predictive modeling in ecology and bio-
geography. These data can be incorporated into ecological models to propagate the
uncertainties through to the final predictions.
